# Third party app development

Ushahidi Platform is designed to be extensible and pluggable. Developers can create applications that connect to Ushahidi Platform in order to access its data, extend its features or automate the integration with other systems.

The following resources are available for such task:

* [REST API Documentation](../api-documentation.md). The REST API makes the data and methods of the Platform available through the network.
* [Web hooks](web-hooks.md) . With Web hooks the platform is able to push events to external systems, in order to continuously notify them of updates in the data.
